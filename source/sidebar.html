  <p>Hi, i'm Přemysl Donát and this is a place where i share things i find interesting.</p>

  <br />
  <p>I'm a web developer. I love and believe in Ruby and the ecosystem around it but i'm also fine with React and other more full-stack things. I really enjoyed Elm. Right now i'm learning Solidity development and blockchain projects. If i had more free time i would like to try Pony, Rust, and plain C.</p>

  <p>I work at <s> <a href="http://uol.cz">UOL</a></s> <a href="http://topmonks.com">topmonks.com</a>. I also have my own tiny company named <a href="http://imagineanything.cz">Imagine Anything</a> under which i run few side projects.</p>

  <p>One of these side projects is <a href="https://damedata.cz">DameData.cz</a>. It's a web app which helps you to easily connect your business with accounting(czech market only right now). Please check it out and get in touch if you have anything on your mind. It's a project which solves various pain points i experienced in my previous employment and most of my free time is dedicated to it:</p>

  <p>If you are interested in more personal things and you want to get to know me, then, well, you have to get to know me!</p>

  <p>Have a good one, Přemek</p>
