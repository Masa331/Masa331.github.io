          <p>Hi everybody!</p>

          <p>Why would you want to create your own static site generator? Because then you won't have a hard time remembering how it works!</p>

          <p>I used to use Jekyll for this small blog but it was a pain for me because i always forgot how it works. And everytime i wanted to use something fancy i had to google it and spent a lot of time just to find how to do some basic thing. So after few posts i migrated to plain HTML and CSS. I'm a web developer so i'm comfortable with these. The only thing i would miss were partials. With plain HTML and CSS one small change in sidebar means manual changes in all blog pages.</p>

          <p>Well, let's see how hard could it be to write my own static site generator:</p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Masa331/8c337ca59e4dc341b7aae675cea57bb2.js"></script>

          <p><b>Turns out it takes only 19 lines in Ruby. And that's all!</b> How it works? It takes all files by some glob matcher, finds lines with "êåâNSERT &lt;partial_path&gt;" keyword in them and substitutes them with content from file in partial_path. Then it takes the modified content and outputs it in some other directory.</p>

          <p>Do you need some other features? Custom variables support? 10 more lines. Automatic transformation of &lt; and &gt into &amp;lt and &amp;gt; for html code snippets? 5 more lines. The thing is, it's totally up to you and it's actually quite easy.</p>

          <p>And other pros?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No more remembering of yet another API</li>
            <li>No need to update anything</li>
            <li>No dependencies</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Which language is best for such thing? Well, the one you are most proficient with. Ruby, JS, Perl, Python, Bash... your choice. And that's yet another advantage.</p>

          <p>Ok, that's all for now because to be happy, i just want partials from my own personal static site generator.</p>

          <p>Have a good one, P≈ôemek</p>
