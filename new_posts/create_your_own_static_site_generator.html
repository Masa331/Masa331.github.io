          <h2>Create your own static site generator</h2>

          <p>Hi everybody!</p>

          <p>Why would you want to create your own static site generator? Because then you won't have a hard time remembering how it works!</p>

          <p>I used to use Jekyll for this small blog but it was a pain for me because i always forgot how it works. And everytime i wanted to use something fancy i had to google it and spent a lot of time just to find how to do some basic thing. So after few posts i migrated to plain HTML and CSS. I'm a web developer so i'm comfortable with these. The only thing i would miss were partials. With plain HTML and CSS one small change in sidebar means manual changes in all blog pages.</p>

          <p>Well, let's see how hard could it be to write my own static site generator:</p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Masa331/8c337ca59e4dc341b7aae675cea57bb2.js"></script>

          <p><b>Turns out it takes only 19 lines in Ruby. And that's all!</b> How it works? It takes all files by some glob matcher, finds lines with "êåâNSERT &lt;partial_path&gt;" keyword in them and substitutes them with content from file in partial_path. Then it takes the modified content and outputs it in some other directory.</p>

          <p>Do you need some other features? Custom variables support? 10 more lines. Automatic transformation of &lt; and &gt into &amp;lt and &amp;gt; for html code snippets? 5 more lines. The thing is, it's totally up to you and it's actually quite easy.</p>

          <p>And other pros?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>No more remembering of yet another API</li>
            <li>No need to update anything</li>
            <li>No dependencies</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Which language is best for such thing? Well, the one you are most proficient with. Ruby, JS, Perl, Python, Bash... your choice. And that's yet another advantage.</p>

          <p>Ok, that's all for now because to be happy, i just want partials from my own personal static site generator.</p>

          <p>Have a good one, P≈ôemek</p>

  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>Hi, i'm P≈ôemysl Don√°t and this is a place where i share things i find interesting.</p>

  <p>This is my picture:</p>

  <br />
  <br />
  <p>I'm a web developer. I love and believe in Ruby and the ecosystem around it but i'm also fine with React and other more full-stack things. I really enjoyed Elm. Right now i'm learning Solidity development and blockchain projects. If i had more free time i would like to try Pony, Rust, and plain C.</p>

  <p>I work at <s> <a href="http://uol.cz">UOL</a></s> <a href="http://topmonks.com">topmonks.com</a>. I also have my own tiny company named <a href="http://imagineanything.cz">Imagine Anything</a> under which i run few side projects.</p>

  <p>One of these side projects is <a href="https://damedata.cz">DameData.cz</a>. It's a web app which helps you to easily connect your business with accounting(czech market only right now). Please check it out and get in touch if you have anything on your mind. It's a project which solves various pain points i experienced in my previous employment and most of my free time is dedicated to it:</p>
